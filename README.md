# Julie-JS-Project42-Memory-Cards-CSS-Local-Storage
Create a set of flash cards with a question and answer for each one.

This project is from the Traversy Media course, 20 Projects with Vanilla Javascript.  I added my own functions to click an Undo button after clearing all cards. The undo uses session storage to re-populate the entire card set that was just cleared.
